# Google Analytics Data Service
> A cloneable repo containing examples and architecture for new dataservices

This project gathers data such as pageviews from our Google Analytics to inform popularity metrics for artworks and other resources.



## Features

This project provides the following endpoints.

* `/v1/artworks` - Get a list of all artworks, sorted by the date they were last updated in descending order. Includes pagination options.
* `/v1/artworks/X` - Get a single artwork



## Overview

This API is part of a larger project at the Art Institute of Chicago to build a data hub for all of
our published dataâ€”a single place that our forthcoming website and future products can access all the
data they might be interested in in a simple, normalized, RESTful way. This project provides an
API in front of our institutional image archive that will feed into the data hub.



## Requirements

In our development, we've used the following software:

* PHP 7.1 (may work in earlier versions but hasn't been tested)
* MySQL 5.7 (may work in earlier versions but hasn't been tested)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
